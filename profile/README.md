# Backend Engineering Mentorship

Welcome to the **Backend Engineering Mentorship Program** â€” a volunteer-driven initiative aimed at helping aspiring students/fresh graduates to unlock their potential through hands-on projects, mentorship, and best practice-driven software development.

This program is led by [Hossam Hamdy](https://github.com/0xGhazy), a software engineer passionate about mentorship, clean code, and practical learning. Itâ€™s designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world development.

## The Motivation

The Java Training Mentorship Program started because I wanted to solve a problem I faced during my college years. Academic learning was often limited by time, outdated content, and the pressure of exams. I wanted to connect what we learn in class to the real-world skills needed in software development.

This program helps others avoid these challenges by offering a more hands-on, practical, and principle-based approach to learning. The goal is to not just understand code but to truly understand it and write it properly.

Another key goal is to create a space for collaborative learning. This means creating an environment where participants can help each other, share ideas, and grow together â€” not just as coders, but as professionals. This also includes building networks, staying motivated, and understanding your rights and responsibilities as a software engineer.

> ðŸ’¡ **And yes â€” it's 100% free, and always will be.**  
> This is a gift to the community, driven by passion community.

## Learning methodology and roadmap

The approach here isnâ€™t about giving you the best solution to every problem. Instead, we want you to apply what you learn to your own projects, which will challenge you with different types of problems. Weâ€™ll then introduce you to the solutions and the design patterns that can solve those problems. This will help you understand patterns and principles â€” what they are, why you need them, and how to use them to tackle specific challenges.

Our goal is for you to learn the core principles that make a strong software engineer, with a deep understanding of key concepts. These principles are the foundation of any framework. While frameworks can change, the fundamentals stay the same. By focusing on the basics, we want to help you become a software engineer who isnâ€™t dependent on any one framework or programming language.

The roadmap is designed for Java programmers, but feel free to pick topics that interest you and learn them on your own.
